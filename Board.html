	<!--Intro to the page-->
	<p>Firstly, you should know the short forms of the pieces. Take a look at the table below.</p>
	<!--Table of how to declare the chess pieces-->
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Chess Piece</th>
			<th>Shortened name</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Pawn</td>
			<td>P or nothing (because the pawn is a very weak piece and there are so many of them, most of the time the pawn is not declared as p</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Bishop</td>
			<td>B</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Knight</td>
			<td>N (Because King and Knight will have the same letter K)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Rook</td>
			<td>R</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Queen</td>
			<td>Q</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>King</td>
			<td>K</td>

	<!--What the chess board looks like and a description-->
	<p> Now, take a look at the chess board. As you can see the sides are numbered 1-8 and the top and 
	bottom have the letters a-h. This is used to coordinate where the peices are. Also we use these 
	numbers so that we know which rows each team uses. White will use rows 1 and 2 when setting up and 
	black will use rows 7 and 8. Take a look at so examples bellow of how we classify where a piece is 
	on the board.</p>
	<!--Image of the chess board numbered and lettered-->

	<!--How to name the locating of the piece-->
	<h4> Example 1: Naming the location of a piece</h4>
	<!--An example of how to name a piece on the board-->
	<img src = "EXA1.jpg"dth="400" height="300" alt="A bishop is placed on the board. We would like to locate the bishop using the grid"/>
	<p>In the image above, I would name the bishop on sqaure d6 as B(for bishop) d6(location) so it will 
	be Bd6. If I wanted to name the white Knight on f3 i would say; Nf3.</p>
	<!--Another example of how to name pieces on the board-->
	<img src = "EXA2.jpg"dth="400" height="300" alt="Locating the black king on the chess board"/>
	<p>In this image, I would name the Black King as Ke8 or the white rook as Rf1</p>

	<!--Declaring the movement of the piece-->
	<h4>Example 2: How to show if a piece moved</h4>
	<!--An example of how to declare if a piece moved-->
	<img src = "EXA4.png"dth="400" height="300" alt="Showing a pawn movment on the board"/>
	<p> In the above example, the pawn was originaly on e2 so to declare the movement of the pawn I would 
	say: Pe2 to e4.</p>
	<!--Another example of how to declare is a piece moved-->
	<img src = "EXA3.gif"dth="400" height="300" alt="Showing a black bishop movement and a white king movement"/>
	<p>In the above image, the black bishop would like to move to h3 so I would write that as Bc8 to h3. 
	Then the white King wants to move to g1 so: Kf1 to g1.
	
	<!--How to name if a piece has taken another-->
	<h4>Example 3: How to show if a piece has captured another</h4>
	<!--An example of how to declare when a piece takes another-->
	<img src = "EXA5.jpg"dth="400" height="300" alt="A bishop capturing a Knight"/>
	<p>In the image above, the bishop would like to take the white knight. We declare a capture with an X. 
	So to show that the bishop on d6 wants to take the Knight on e5 we say: bd6 X Ne5.</p>
	<!--Another example if a piece is being taken-->
	<img src = "Ziyaan EXA6.jpg"dth="400" height="300" alt=""/>
	<p>In the above image the white knight on f3 wants to take the black Knight on d4 before it takes 
	their queen. We declare this as Nf3 X Nd4</p>
