	<h1>Different pieces and how they move</h1>

	<!--How the pawn moves-->
	<h4>The Pawn</h4>
	<p>The pawn is the weakest piece on the board. It can only move 1 square at a time or 2 squares
	on its first move. It can attack and take a piece by moving up diagonally one square but it cannot 
	move backwards. If you are able to get a pawn to the other side of the chess board you will be able 
	to convert the pawn into a bishop, knight, rook or queen. This will help you take advantage of the 
	game.</p>

	<!--The Bishop and how it moves-->
	<h4>The Bishop</h4>
	<p>The Bishops are the pieces that sits beside the King and the Queen which means they are placed 
	on different colour squares. The bishop moves diagonally as far as you want them to go and can capture 
	a piece by moving diagonaly into it.</p>

	<!--The Knight and how it moves-->
	<h4>The Knight</h4>
	<p> The knight is a very unusual piece, It moves in a L shape and if there are any peices in the knights 
	path, no problem! The knight can 'jump' over any peices in the L shape. It can capture a piece if it is 
	sitting at the end of the knights path.</p>

	<!--The Rook and how it moves-->
	<h4> The Rook</h4>
	<p> The rook moves in two ways. Left or right and up or down as far as you want. It can capture by 
	moving towards the piece it the directions they are allowed to move in.</p>

	<!--The Queen and how it moves-->
	<h4>The Queen</h4>
	<p> The queen is the most powerful piece on the board because it can move diagonally, right and left, 
	up and down as far as you want. It is able to capture pieces from long distances so it is good to have 
	more queens in a game.</p>

	<!--The King and how it moves-->
	<h4>The King</h4>
	<p> The king is the most important piece in the game however it can only move 1 square (in any direction) 
	at a time.</p>
	<!--Image of how the King moves-->
