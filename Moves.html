	<!--Information about castling-->
	<h4 id="Castle">Castling</h4>
	<!--Castle king side-->
	<p>Castling involves the king and the rook. There are 2 ways you can castle. The first way is castling on
	the kings side where there is only a rook, bishop and a knight. In order to castle the knight and the 
	bishop have to be removed so the king and the rook have a clear path. Then the king can move 2 spaces 
	to the right and the rook can 'jump'over the king and move 2 spaces to the left.</p>

	<!--Castle queen side-->
	<p>When castling queen side the queen, bishop and the knight have to be removed so the king and the
	rook have a clear path. The king can then move 2 spaces to the left and the rook can 'jump' over the
	king and move 3 spaces to the right. Look at the picture bellow for more detail.</p>

	<!--2 move checkmate-->
	<h4 id="2check">The 2 move check mate</h4>

	<!--what is the process?-->
	<p>The 2 move check mate is usually done by the black team. It is a play where the white pawn on f2 
	moves to f3 and the pawn on g2 moves to g3. The black queen can then move to h4 to put the king in 
	checkmate. Take a look below how this process works.</p>

	<!--En passant information, image and further explanation-->
	<h4 id="passant">En Passant</h4>

	<p>En passant is a french term meaning 'in passing'. En passant is a very complicated move done by
	the pawns. En passant is when 1 pawn captures another by moving diagonally IN FRONT of the other.
	This happens when both pawns are next to eachother and 1 moves diagonally in front of the other.
	Take a look at the image bellow:</p>

	<p>As you can see in the image, the black and white pawns are next to each other and the black pawn 
	is able to capture the white by moving diagonally in front of it. Most chess players forget about this
	move and it is not well known in the game</p>

	<!--Pawn promotion; how it works, what is the advantage. No image included-->
	<h4 id="pawn">Pawn Promotion</h4>

	<p>You may remember that i had talked about pawn promotion in <a href='Piece.html'>Different pieces and how they move.</a>
	Pawn promotion is very simple, all you have to do is get your pawn to the other side of the chess board and you can choose
	to upgrade your pawn to a; rook, bishop, knight or queen. Many people choose queen but it depends on what you need
	in your game that you are playing.</p>
